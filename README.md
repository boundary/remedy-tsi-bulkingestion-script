## Configuration
   The configuration file contains three major sections.


    1. "config":{}
    2. "eventDefinition":{}
    3. "@placeholder":{}


### 1) Config

#### The config element contains all the required configuration to run this script.
```
"config": {
  "remedyHostName":"xxxx"  					---> ARServer Host name
  "remedyUserName":"xxxx",  					---> ARServer UserName
  "remedyPassword":"xxxx",					---> Password
  "tsiApiToken":"xxxx",       					---> TSI API Token
  "startDateTime":"2016-12-31 00:00:00 UTC", 	 		---> Start Date for Remedy conditionFields
  "endDateTime":"2017-12-31 00:00:00 UTC", 			---> End date for remedy conditionFields
}

```


### 2) Event Definition
```
Payload field and value						Details/Comment
"eventDefinition": {						---> Event Definition
  "properties": {
    "app_id": "Remedy Ingestion script" 			---> Change the App_Id as Required
  }
 }
```

### 3) Placeholder Definition 
There are several Field Definitions/ Placeholder definitions already available by default(see [IncidentDefaultTemplate](https://github.com/boundary/remedy-tsi-bulkingestion-script/blob/master/templates/incidentDefaultTemplate.json) & [ChangeDefaultTemplate](https://github.com/boundary/remedy-tsi-bulkingestion-script/blob/master/templates/changeDefaultTemplate.json) ). You can add a custom Field Definition & use it in the properties section of eventDefinition as per requirement.
```
"@CUSTOMFIELD": {
		"fieldId":1000000162,
		"valueMap":{
			"1000": "Critical",
			"2000": "High",
			"3000": "Medium",
			"4000": "Low"
		}
	},
```

```
Example

{
"eventDefinition": {						  
		"properties": {
			"app_id": "Remedy Ingestion script",
			"CustomFieldName":"@CUSTOMFIELD"				---> Add Custom additional fields like this
		}
 },
 "@CUSTOMFIELD": {
		"fieldId":1000000162,
		"valueMap":{
			"1000": "Critical",
			"2000": "High",
			"3000": "Medium",
			"4000": "Low"
		}
	}
}
```
> 1. The placeholder definition contains the Remedy `fieldId` , which defines that this fieldId's value from Remedy entry will be used in place of this placeholder.

> 2. If valueMap is present in the definition its value would be used from valueMap otherwise the Remedy value will be used.
